SuperAdmin Priveleges (Adding School to db):

login: superadmin1
password: superadmin

=> creates admin user
Admin user can create either Teacher or Student users

The system is gonna send you both login and password to the specified email, once you register a new user, so you wouldn't lose it. Every school is gonna have its own bunch of users working in their own ecosystem. Edit/Delete seem to work pretty smooth, new functions are incoming.
